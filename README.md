Welcome to Pug Run! This game is all about survival, and there really isn't a way to win. 
When you press play, cannon balls will come from two directions trying to hit you. 
They have different sizes and their speed correlates with how long te game has been going. 
You are a pug trying to jump, run, and out manuver these cannonballs to the bet of your ability. 
If you collide with one of the cannon balls, the game is over, and your longest time is recorded. 
Try and beat your high score and have fun!
